Hi, I’m **Abdullah Saihan**, an Artificial Intelligence Engineer based in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Most of my work revolves around machine learning, large language models, and AI-driven applications — exploring how these technologies can solve real-world problems.

I enjoy designing end-to-end solutions — from training models and crafting APIs to automating deployments and optimizing infrastructure. My curiosity drives me to keep learning, experimenting, and sharing what I discover.

**Saihan’s Space** is my corner of the web — a place for my thoughts, experiments, notes, and reflections on technology.
